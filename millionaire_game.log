2025-02-26 13:09:25,678 - millionaire_game - ERROR - Failed to parse JSON from Ollama response: Here's a "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" style multiple-choice question on idioms:

```json
{
  "question": "What does the idiom 'Bite off more than you can chew' mean?",
  "options": [
    {"label": A, "text": "To take on fewer responsibilities than you are capable of"},
    {"label": B, "text": "To accept a challenge that is beyond your skills or abilities"},
    {"label": C, "text": "To avoid doing something you don't want to do"},
    {"label": D, "text": "To finish what you start"}
  ],
  "correct_answer": A,
  "explanation": "This idiom means to take on more responsibilities or tasks than you are capable of handling. It is often used to advise someone not to overcommit themselves."
}
```

In this question, option B (Bite off more than you can chew) is the correct answer because it directly corresponds with the common understanding and usage of the idiom. Options A, C, and D provide plausible but incorrect distractors that may test contestants' knowledge and critical thinking skills.

The phrase "Bite off more than you can chew" originated in the mid-19th century, when it was used to describe someone who had taken on too much work or responsibility, much like a person trying to eat more food than their stomach can handle. Over time, the idiom has evolved into its current form, but its meaning remains the same: to overcommit oneself.

This type of question requires contestants to demonstrate their understanding of English language idioms and figurative language, making it an appropriate challenge for "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" on this topic.

```

In this question, option A ("Good luck") is the correct answer because it aligns with common usage and cultural practices. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not match the actual meaning or origin of the phrase "break a leg."

}
```

This question tests the contestant's ability to identify the correct verb tense, which is a fundamental concept in English grammar. The options provided include some common but incorrect tenses (Past Perfect and Present Perfect), as well as another correct but less commonly used tense (Past Continuous). This should provide a good challenge for the contestant while still being fair and solvable with the right answer.

In this question, the distractor options (A and D) are plausible, but incorrect. Option A uses the same base form as the original word, while option D adds an unfamiliar suffix (-ness). Only option B correctly forms the comparative adjective by adding the correct prefix (-erly).

Note: The prefix/suffix pattern used in this question is a common one in English language learning, making it challenging but fair for 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' contestants.

This question tests the player's understanding of verb tenses and their ability to identify the correct form for a specific context. The options include two distractors (Past Perfect and Future Perfect) that are less likely to be chosen, as well as Present Continuous, which is not relevant to this context.
